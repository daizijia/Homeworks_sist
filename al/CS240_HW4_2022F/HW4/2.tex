In HW3, you've considered the problem that optimally assign $m$ items to two players. Now suppose there are $n$ players and each of them has a unique valuation and an upper bound. Provide a 2-approximation algorithm to solve the problem and prove it.

\solution{
2-approximation algorithm:
从大到小先放各自价值最大的物品，万一冲突，在谁那里价值更大而且放得下，就放谁那。
