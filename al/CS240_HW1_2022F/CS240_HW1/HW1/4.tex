\problem{}
In the new semester, SIST offers some courses for students. Students are required to take only one course. We asked n students "how many other students took the same course as you?" and collected the answers in an integer array answer where answer[i] is the answer of the i-th student.

Given an array answer, return the minimum number of students that could be in SIST.

\solution{
The minimum number of students comes from when some students have the same answer we consider they are in the same class. But if too many students have the same answer that is mean the number of them lager than their answer, there might be more than one same class. According to the analysis above, the pseudocode of solution is given:
\begin{algorithm}[]  %其中这里面不能有H不然会报错，不过不影响结果
	\caption{Problem 4}%算法名字
	\KwIn{Array answer, n}%输入参数
	\KwOut{The minimum number of student sum}%输出
	A = Quicksort(answer)
	
	$same = 1,sum = 0$
	
	\ForEach{item in A}{
		\eIf{$A_i = A_{i+1}$}{
			1\;$same = same + 1$
		}{
			2\;$sum = sum + (1+[\frac{same-1}{A_i}])\cdot A_i$, $same = 1$
		}
	}
	\Return sum
\end{algorithm}
