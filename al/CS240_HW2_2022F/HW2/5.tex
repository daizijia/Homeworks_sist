\problem{}
Given three sequences L1, L2 and L, whose length is m, n and m+n respectively. Design an efficient algorithm to check if L1 and L2 can be merged into L such that all the letter orders in L1 and L2 stay unchanged with optimal time complexity. Analyze the algorithm's time complexity and space complexity.\\
\textit{Example 1: L1 = aabb, L2 = cba, L = acabbab, then return true.}\\
\textit{Example 2: L1 = aabb, L2 = cba, L = aaabbbc, then return false.}

\textbf{Solution:}

Use the dynamic programming to solve the problem. There is a matrix $dp[m,n]$ to save the result. The elements in $dp$ symbolize whether the first $i$ letters in L1 and the first $j$ letters in L2 can be merge into the first $i+j$ letters in L. The state transition equation is as following:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq6}
	dp[i,j]=\left\{
	\begin{aligned}
		True & , & dp[i-1,j] = True\wedge L1[i] = L[i+j] \\
		True & , & dp[i,j-1] = True\wedge L2[j] = L[i+j] \\
		False & , & else.
	\end{aligned}
	\right.
\end{equation}

\textbf{Analysis:}

The algorithm's time complexity is $O(mn)$, for we just compute the value of elements in matrix $dp[m,n]$ only once. The space complexity is $O(mn)$ too, because we just make a size of $m*n$ matrix.
